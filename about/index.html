Nothing excites me more than an opportunity to work on a product which is well designed, well engineered and run by people who care about their craft.</p><p>My primary specialization is building apps for Apple platforms (mostly iOS), something I started in early 2014. Since then I had an opportunity to work on multiple products of various scale, from MVPs to full-fledged enterprise solutions.</p><p>I'm passionate about building amazing products and I focus on learning new things about iOS or the Swift Programming Language every single day. Other than that I'm on my way to learn another stack in the near future.</p><h2>Interests âœ¨</h2><p>I'm interested in further work on Apple platforms - not only iOS, but also macOS/watchOS/tvOS. Other than that, I'm open for learning Server-Side Swift with Vapor and other technologies such as TypeScript, Node or C#.</p><p>I have a soft spot for functional programming and I'm interested in doing some Haskell/F# as side projects to improve my understanding of functional paradigms in other languages. I'm also okay with reactive programming, but I don't consider it a must.</p><p>I currently don't do web development, React Native, Flutter or Android, however I'm open for such change if needed. I don't have any commercial experience with React Native, but that's definitely something I'd like to try one day.</p><h2>Contact ðŸ“¬</h2><p>You can find me on <a href="https://www.github.com/pawelurb/">GitHub</a> or reach out to me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/pawelurbanowicz/">Twitter</a>.</p></div><footer><p>Â© 2020-2021 Pawel Urbanowicz</p><p>Made in Swift with <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a> and <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/splash">Splash</a> ðŸš€</p></footer></body></html>
